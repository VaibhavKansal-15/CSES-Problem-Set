# CSES Problem Set - Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my repository where I am solving problems from the *CSES Problem Set* to improve my competitive programming and problem-solving skills.

## About CSES Problem Set

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic problems created by the *Institute of Computer Science* at the *University of Helsinki*. It includes a variety of problems that range from basic data structures to more advanced topics in algorithms.

The goal of solving these problems is to gain a deep understanding of various computer science concepts, improve problem-solving speed, and build strong programming skills, especially for competitive programming contests.

You can access the CSES Problem Set [here](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

## Why I Started This Journey

As someone passionate about programming and eager to improve problem-solving skills, I decided to take on the CSES Problem Set. My primary goal is to:

- *Enhance my problem-solving ability*: By tackling problems of varying difficulty, I can develop a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking.
- *Learn new concepts*: The problems cover diverse topics such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.
- *Prepare for coding competitions: Solving these problems will help me build speed and precision, which is crucial for competitive programming contests such as **Codeforces, **LeetCode, and **AtCoder*.

## Structure of This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems in the CSES Problem Set. The structure of the repositoryÂ isÂ asÂ follows:

- *Problem Files*: Each problem is stored in a separate file with the problem name as the filename.
- *Programming Language: I solve the problems primarily in **C++, but other languages (like **Python* or *Java*) may also be used in certain problems.
  
## My Progress

I have started solving problems in the following categories:

- *Introduction*: Getting familiar with basic problem-solving techniques.
- *Sorting and Searching*: Focusing on efficient algorithms for handling arrays and data.
- *Dynamic Programming*: Aiming to solve optimization problems through dynamic programming.
- *Graph Algorithms*: Exploring graph theory and algorithms like BFS, DFS, and shortest paths.

## How You Can Use This Repository

- *Learning*: If youâ€™re also starting with competitive programming, you can use this repository as a resource to understand how I approach the problems.
- *Contributing*: If you find any issues or optimizations in my solutions, feel free to open a pull request.
- *Collaborating*: If you're working through the same problem set, feel free to reach out to discuss problems or share your insights.

## My Approach to Problem Solving

- *Understand the Problem*: I start by reading the problem statement carefully, ensuring I understand the input, output, and constraints.
- *Plan the Solution*: I try to come up with an optimal solution, considering different algorithms and data structures that could be used.
- *Write the Code*: I implement the solution in a clean and readable manner, following best practices.
- *Test the Solution*: I test the code on multiple test cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
- *Refactor if Necessary*: If I identify ways to optimize the solution or make the code cleaner, I refactor it.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- *Programming Languages*: C++, Python, Java (depending on the problem)
- *IDE/Editor*: Visual Studio Code, CLion
- *Version Control*: Git and GitHub for tracking progress and sharing solutions

## Future Plans

As I continue to work through the CSES Problem Set, I plan to:

- Complete all problems in the set.
- Explore advanced topics like graph theory, geometry, and advanced dynamic programming.
- Participate in coding competitions and contests to further refine my skills.

## Conclusion

The CSES Problem Set is a fantastic resource for anyone looking to improve their problem-solving and algorithmic skills. By solving these problems, I hope to enhance my understanding of key computer science concepts and become more efficient at solving challenging problems in competitive programming.

Feel free to explore my solutions, leave feedback, and join me in this learning journey!
